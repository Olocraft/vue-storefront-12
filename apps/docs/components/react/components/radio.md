## Accessibility notes

- Providing a bigger hit area for your radio buttons - select a radio button by clicking on its associated `label` element, as well as on the radio button itself
- [ARIA - radio role:](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Roles/radio_role) The radio role is one of a group of checkable buttons, in a radiogroup, where no more than one of the buttons can be checked at a time.
- A radio element is a checkable input in a group of role elements, of which only one of which can be checked at a time. The radio elements must be grouped together in a [`radiogroup`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Roles/radiogroup_role) to indicate which ones affect the same value.
